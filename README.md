# Mechanicus Syntax Theme

Initially a blend between Monokai and One Dark, Mechanicus is a camouflage looking color scheme with slightly higher contrast.

The theme works as intended for the following languages: PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Python (as of 4.1.0)

## Roadmap

Since I primarily built this theme for myself, the last language I would like to properly colour is C/C++. With the theme as it is, the support is nearly ready, but it is not yet consistent with the other languages. If I decide to move to a new language, I might add consistent colouring for it as well.
